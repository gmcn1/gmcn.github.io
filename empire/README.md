# Empire
Empire Incremental

An incremental game about building an empire through city building and colonization.
Empire Incremental combines elements of a clicker with an idler and has lots of micromanagement.

## Roadmap
1. __Smelting__

    Mined ore will require smelting to convert the raw ore into useful ignots.
    
2. __Manufactured Goods__

    Add factories to the game which produce various goods, some might be needed for advanced construction projects; other could just be valueable items to sell for profit.

3. __Exploration__

	The first step in colonization is discovering places to colonize, this will be like an advanced version of the prospecting system to discover new places and perhaps unique encounters.

4. __Outposts__

	The player will advance beyond the starting city and construct outposts which will gain access to mineral deposits that contain better consentrations of rare materials. These outposts will have some kind of extra challenge involved in maintaining them, not currently a fully fleshed out idea.

5. __Biomes__

	New locations will have different biomes which govern what kinds of challenges and resources are encountered there.

6. __Trade__

	Making contact with neutral settlements could allow for trade.

7. __Conquest__

	Why trade when you can just take it? Train soilders and equip them with weapons to take what you need.

8. __Space__

	Eventually the player will advance into the space age and build colonies on other planets, these colonies will be difficult to develop but yield rare materials.

9. __Base building__

	Allow the player to design their city layout instead of just building quantities of things.

10. __Random events__

	Stuff to add flair to the game and reduce predictability.

11. __Offline mode__

	When you reload progress should be advanced as if you had left the game window up and running unattended.

12. __Convoys__

    Moving materials between cities will require setting up convoys.
    
13. __Building Upgrades__

    Many basic building types will be upgradable which might allow more workers to be assigned to them or provide other enhancements.
    
14. __Advanced Mining__

    After prospecting a location the player who has aquired newer mine technology should be presented with options to build a basic mine or some kind of more expensive advanced mine (deep borehole, etc).

15. __Education__

    All jobs are currently unskilled labor, but eventually there will be high tech jobs which required educated workers, which in turn means there needs to be an education system.
