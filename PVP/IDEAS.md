# Ideas

I'm collecting here the list of ideas gathered during the development. Who knows?

## Arcade mode

 * _Mission:_ Capture the flag and bring them to the bases
 * _Mission:_ Kills on conveyor belts
 * _Mission:_ Kills enemy with specific weapons

## Game modes

 * _Double weapons_: Wield two weapons! _(suggested by The Kusagari)_
 * _Stretch mode_: Winning players are larger and easier to hit _(suggested by The Kusagari)_
     * There may be a problem with doors for too large players!
 * _Zombie mode:_ Three survivors, one zombie. Zombie kills become zombies. Survivor with most kills wins. _(suggested by NinJoe)_
     * Probably fun with more than 4 players

## Server

 * _Horde:_ Spread drones management over other players?

## GUI

 * _Teams:_ Mark the teams on the game setup screen

## Maps

 * _Teleports:_ A very teleport-intensive map
 * _Classic FPS:_ A map structured like a non-multiplayer FPS (i.e. Wolfenstein 3D)
 * _Metro:_ A cliche environment I always love, that offers corridors and symmetries

## Engine

 * _Wall tops:_ Add a top to walls to make lower blocks and even stairs
 * _Consecutive thin walls:_ to make glasses etc.

## Audio

 * _Sound generator:_ Merge a sound generator to reduce loading times?
